/**
 * Import variables, abstractions, base styles and components using globbing.
 *
 * Globbing will always import files alphabetically. Optimally, all your
 * components should be self-contained and explicit enough to not have any
 * contained styles leak into unrelated components: The import order should not
 * affect the result.
 *
 * If there are variables, functions or mixins that depend on each other and
 * therefore need to be imported in a specific order you can import them
 * directly. Variables-, function- or mixin providing partials should never
 * output any styles themselves: Importing them multiple times to resolve
 * dependencies shouldn't be a problem.
