# Components
This directory should contain full components (modules in SMACSS), their
sub-components and modifiers.

Components are discrete parts of your page that should sit within the regions
of your layouts. You should try to abstract your components as much as possible
to promote reuse throughout the theme. Components should be flexible enough to
respond to any width and should never rely on context for styling.
This allows modules to be placed throughout the theme with no risk of them breaking.

If you find you need to change the look of a component depending on it's context
you should avoid using context based classes at all costs. Instead it is better
to add another "modifier" class to the component to alter the styling. Again,
this promotes reuse.

Sub-components are the individual parts that make up a component. As a general
rule, adding a class to target a sub-component is a much better option than
using descendant selectors or element selectors. In many cases sub-components
can be made more reusable by making them components in their own right, so they
can then be used within other components.

Almost everything that doesn't belong in base should be made a component.
